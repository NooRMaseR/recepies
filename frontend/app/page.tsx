          <h1>Let us tell you a short story about the potential of enzymes.</h1>
          <p>
            Flour is the key ingredient in bread, and has been one of life&#39;s
            elixirs for many cultures throughout human history. The milling
            wheat culture has existed for thousands of years and has
            significantly supported human development. Flour has meant life for
            many cultures. Today, more than 5,000 mills around the world produce
            around 450 million tons of flour annually. The natural fluctuating
            quality of flour is a daily challenge for every miller.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Nowadays, the addition of high-tech enzyme preparations plays an
            important role in flour production and its improvement. Enzymes are
            natural proteins that catalyse biological reactions. This helps the
            industry achieve flour standardization by producing flours with
            improved, consistent baking properties. Most enzyme production
            worldwide is based in Europe, mainly in Germany, Denmark, and
            France. Globalization has made enzyme-based flour improvers
            available around the world, but their key ingredients are most often
            produced in the European enzyme hub.
